# **Local AI Agent with RAG**

Welcome to **Local AI Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**! This repository presents a powerful, efficient, and modular AI agent that works locally without relying on external cloud services. With the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the AI agent combines generative capabilities with the retrieval of precise, contextual information from local or specified data sources.

---

## **📌 Purpose of the Project**

This project aims to:
- Build a **private, secure, and cost-effective AI agent** that runs entirely on local infrastructure.
- Enhance the AI’s ability to provide **accurate and context-specific outputs** by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Enable integration with **custom datasets** and **local resources** for domain-specific applications.
- Demonstrate the feasibility of **cutting-edge AI solutions** without reliance on external data pipelines.

## **📖 How It Works**
Data Preprocessing: The pipeline processes and indexes your local/custom data.

Contextual Retrieval: The system queries the indexed data to fetch relevant context.

Generative Outputs: Combines retrieved context with language model capabilities to generate outputs.

Seamless Integration: Outputs are ready for consumption by downstream applications or interfaces.
